To complete this project efficiently while keeping the MVP goals and structure in mind, here's a step-by-step **roadmap**:

---

### **Phase 1: Backend Setup (MVP Core)**

#### **Step 1: Authentication System**
- **Backend:**
  1. Implement user registration and login functionality in `userRoutes.js` and `userController.js`.
  2. Hash passwords using `bcrypt` and generate JWT tokens for authentication.
  3. Set up a middleware (`auth.js`) to verify JWT tokens for protected routes.
- **Frontend:**
  1. Build the `Login` and `Register` pages with forms to send POST requests to the backend.
  2. Validate inputs on both frontend and backend, showing errors to the user if validation fails.

#### **Step 2: Database Integration**
- **Backend:**
  1. Set up MongoDB with Mongoose using the `config/database.js` file.
  2. Create schemas for users and trips (`userModel.js` and `tripModel.js`).
  3. Seed initial data (`utils/seedDatabase.js`) for testing.
- Ensure `userModel.js` supports roles (`admin` and `normal` users).

#### **Step 3: Error Handling**
- Implement a centralized error handler (`errorHandler.js`) for catching validation, authentication, and other errors. Ensure proper HTTP status codes and meaningful error messages.

#### **Milestone Completion:** Backend API endpoints for authentication, user management, and trip management are operational and tested with Postman.

### **Phase 2: Frontend Setup (Core Pages)**

#### **Step 1: Frontend Boilerplate**
1. Set up the React app using Vite.
2. Add routing with `React Router` and authentication context using `useContext` or Zustand.
3. Build global reusable components:
   - **Button:** Styled according to the style guide.
   - **Navbar/Sidebar:** Responsive navigation with conditional links based on user roles.
   - **Input Fields:** Standardized styles for forms.

#### **Step 2: Welcome Page**
- Build the `Welcome` page as a marketing page with a CTA to sign in/register.

#### **Step 3: Authentication**
1. Integrate `Login` and `Register` pages with backend APIs.
2. Store JWT in local storage and use it for authenticated requests.
3. Redirect users post-login to their respective dashboards.

---

### **Phase 3: User Dashboard and Trip Reporting**

#### **Step 1: Dashboard Page**
1. Fetch user-specific trips (`/users/:userID/trips` endpoint).
2. Display:
   - Recent trips with `year + title` format.
   - Filters for status, date, etc.
   - A CTA for creating a new trip report if no trips exist.
3. Implement reusable trip card components with hover effects.

#### **Step 2: Trip Reporting Page**
1. Create the `TripReport` page:
   - Form inputs for location, date, and allowances.
   - Calculate total allowances using Skatteverket data.
   - Submit reports to the backend using a POST request.
2. Add functionality to edit and delete reports.

#### **Step 3: Profile Page**
1. Fetch and display user details from `/users/:userID`.
2. Allow users to update their information (e.g., name, profile image).

---

### **Phase 4: Admin Dashboard**

1. **Admin Features:**
   - View all users and trips.
   - Approve or reject trip reports.
   - Filter and search trips based on users, location, or status.
2. Ensure actions like approval trigger backend updates (`PUT` or `PATCH` endpoints).

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Testing**

#### **Step 1: Testing**
1. Test all API endpoints with Postman for edge cases.
2. Ensure frontend functionality with browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. Validate responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

#### **Step 2: Deployment**
1. Deploy the backend on Heroku or any cloud provider.
2. Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
3. Configure environment variables for production (e.g., API base URL, JWT secret).

---

### **Phase 6: Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)**

1. **Day/Night Mode:** Add a toggle for users to switch between light and dark themes.
2. **Favorite Locations:** Store and fetch frequently used locations for faster trip creation.
3. **Notifications:** Notify users of trip approval/rejection status updates.
4. **Additional Filters:** Add advanced filters for trips (e.g., year, location).

---

### **Roadmap Summary**

1. **Phase 1 (Backend Setup)**: Complete the API for authentication, user, and trip management.
2. **Phase 2 (Frontend Setup)**: Implement core pages like Welcome, Login/Register, and reusable components.
3. **Phase 3 (Core Features)**: Develop Dashboard, Trip Reporting, and Profile Pages.
4. **Phase 4 (Admin Features)**: Build admin tools for trip approval and management.
5. **Phase 5 (Testing & Deployment)**: Test and deploy the full-stack application.
6. **Phase 6 (Stretch Goals)**: Add enhancements like day/night mode and notifications.

By following this roadmap, you'll ensure a well-structured project that aligns with your MVP goals while allowing room for enhancements in the future
